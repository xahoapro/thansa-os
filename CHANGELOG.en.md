# Changelog

*[Tiếng Việt](CHANGELOG.md) · **English***

Javis OS release history, newest first. You can also read it inside the app under **Settings → Updates**.

English entries start at 0.66.0. Every earlier release is described in the Vietnamese [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), which remains the maintainer's original; the in-app Updates page shows those older entries in Vietnamese.

Format: each release is a `## [x.y.z] - date` block, with changes grouped under `### Added / Fixed / Improved / Security`.

## [0.70.2] - 2026-10-03
### Security
- **The sign-in screen now fully covers the dashboard.** It used to sit over the dashboard behind a blur, so you could still make out the layout underneath, most clearly in the light theme. The backdrop is now solid: until you sign in, all you see is the sign-in box. Your data was already blocked by the server; this hides the rest.

## [0.70.1] - 2026-10-03
### Improved
- **The README explains why your data stays yours.** "Why Javis" now covers the lock-in of keeping all your work on one AI vendor, and lists where each thing you build up (chat history, memory, skills, agents, workflows) lives on your machine, so a new model is a switch, not a fresh start.
- **A row of flags at the top of the README.** Twelve flags, each linking to its translation. Emoji flags show as letters on Windows; these are real images.

## [0.70.0] - 2026-10-03
### Improved
- **Five animated diagrams in the README:** one-command install, a swappable brain that keeps every tool, one chat message turning into the right action, a growing Second Brain, and work running overnight. They are light, sharp on phones, and hold still when the device asks for reduced motion.
- **The README in 7 more languages:** Hindi, Portuguese, Korean, Russian, German, French and Indonesian, 12 in all. Language bars are generated from one list, so they never miss a language or point at a missing page.

## [0.69.0] - 2026-10-03
### Improved
- **The README now also comes in Chinese, Spanish and Japanese**, and so does the quick start. Each says plainly that it is a machine translation, that Javis replies in any language, and that the interface is in English and Vietnamese.
- **Stale translations get flagged.** After an edit to the English README, GitHub points out which translations need updating, without blocking a release.
- **The website folder is gone.** The landing page will live elsewhere, which keeps the repo lean.

## [0.68.1] - 2026-10-03
### Improved
- **The GitHub page shows a real brain.** The screenshot at the top of the README and the link preview image now show the graph of a brain with more than 1,600 notes, instead of an empty one.

## [0.68.0] - 2026-10-03
### Improved
- **The Updates page speaks English.** Devices reading in English see the release notes in English from 0.66.0 on; older releases still show in Vietnamese.
- **Open to international contributors.** The repo now has an English contributing guide, an architecture overview and a glossary of the Vietnamese names used in the code, plus forms for bug reports, feature requests and translation offers.
- **A security policy and a code of conduct.** Security problems are reported privately, never in a public issue.

## [0.67.0] - 2026-10-02
### Improved
- **Javis now speaks English all the way through.** Error messages, the Models page, the connection store (descriptions, guides, permission warnings), the Plugins page and newly created brains all appear in English when your browser is set to English. Vietnamese users see exactly what they saw before.
- **One language per device.** A phone set to Vietnamese and a laptop set to English each see their own language, including the text that comes back from the server.
- **The website has an English version**, with the Vietnamese one a click away under "Tiếng Việt" in the menu.

## [0.66.0] - 2026-10-02
### Improved
- **The GitHub page is now in English**, with real screenshots, a table of the 12 brains and a language bar. The Vietnamese version is complete too, one click away at the top of the page.
- **The interface follows your browser's language** on a device that has not picked one yet. A device already using Vietnamese keeps it.
- **Anything not translated yet shows in English** instead of Vietnamese, so people reading in another language can still follow it.
- **The Linux/macOS install and update scripts print their messages in English.**
