# 🧠 Thansa OS

**A model-agnostic agentic AI layer + Second Brain - swap the brain (Claude Code, ChatGPT/Codex, Antigravity CLI, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic API, Groq, Ollama) without losing tools: voice, a knowledge graph, MCP-driven business reporting, and a self-improvement loop.**

## What is Thansa?

Thansa OS is **not** a chatbot. It is a **self-hosted agentic AI** running on your own machine or VPS: it reads and writes files, calls tools (MCP), runs skills, queues background work, schedules itself - all wrapped in a **voice-controlled dashboard** with a **Second Brain** (memory + wiki) that accumulates knowledge over time.

**You pick the brain, and you can change it whenever you like.** Ten paths work today: **Claude Code**, **ChatGPT/Codex** and **Antigravity CLI** (these run on the subscription you already pay for - no separate API purchase), plus **Gemini CLI · OpenRouter · OpenAI API · Google Gemini · Anthropic API · Groq · Ollama Cloud** (an API key is all they need).

> ⚠️ **Read this before letting a subscription run background work.** Anthropic scopes Claude Pro/Max to **ordinary personal use** of Claude Code. Continuous background execution (loops, reminders, Kanban jobs, chatbots), running on a VPS, or several people sharing one account all fall outside that scope, and accounts **have been suspended** over it. Thansa does not read your login token (that path was removed in 0.26.17) - it runs the `claude` binary itself, but that does not make round-the-clock background use legitimate either. If you want to be safe: on the **Models** page set Claude Code to run on an **API key**, or point the **background-work model** at a different provider. See `server/claude_auth.py`.

> ⚠️ **Gemini CLI no longer covers personal tiers.** Google cut personal Code Assist off on 18 June 2026. The CLI returns `IneligibleTierError` / `UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT` on the free tier, Google AI Pro and Ultra alike; only an enterprise Code Assist licence or an API key still works. That is a server-side block on Google's end, not a misconfiguration. For Gemini models on a personal Google plan, use **Antigravity CLI** instead - same model line-up as the Antigravity IDE, including non-Google models.

> The philosophy: **capability lives in Thansa, not in the model.** Every brain gets the same toolbox through one shared connection hub (MCP Hub) - wired-up MCP servers, brain read/write tools, skills, Kanban jobs, agents, workflows, loops and reminders. The only real difference: the CLI engines can also run **shell commands**, fetch a URL, search the web and spawn sub-agents. Switching from Claude to Gemini costs you nothing beyond that.

You wire in **your own connections** (POS/sales, ads, calendar, email, Zalo, notes…) → Thansa discovers them and **reports on your business and your life** with real numbers, in plain speech.

### What makes Thansa different

| | An ordinary chatbot | **Thansa OS** |
|---|---|---|
| Brain | Hard-wired to one model, one stateless API call per message | **Swappable**: 10 providers, each with the full set of tools, MCP, skills and sessions |
| Memory | Forgets after every session | **A living Second Brain** - remembers you, thickens with every conversation |
| Data | Made up, or absent | **Real numbers** from the connections you wire in (POS, Ads, Calendar, Zalo…) |
| Self-improvement | None | **Background loops** + an AI-run work queue |
| Interface | A chat box | Dashboard + knowledge graph + **hands-free voice** + Telegram |
| Deployment | Locked to one vendor | **Self-hosted**: Hostinger one-click / Docker / any VPS |

> 💡 **Philosophy:** Thansa *compiles* knowledge once, from raw notes into a Wiki, then *maintains* it alive against every new source. Knowledge **accumulates** instead of being rediscovered each time.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎙️ **Hands-free voice** - speak, and Thansa listens and answers out loud. Pick your voice provider: Edge TTS (free, default), OpenAI or ElevenLabs.
- 🌌 **Knowledge graph** - your brain rendered as a network of notes joined by `[[wikilink]]`, on a light canvas that works offline.
- 💬 **Conversation sessions** - save, reopen and **full-text search** every past conversation; long sessions are compacted into summaries instead of having their memory truncated.
- 🗂️ **File manager** - browse, **edit `.md`/`.txt` right in the browser**, search files by name or by content, upload and download.
- 🧩 **Skills** - group, search, **toggle individually**, add/edit/delete, import/export as packages; Thansa files new skills into the right group by itself.
- 🧰 **Plugins** - drop in a Python folder and every engine gains a **native tool or hook**, with no core changes.
- 🤖 **Agents & workflows** - build specialist assistants (each with its own memory) plus multi-step automation chains with verification steps.
- ♻️ **Recurring jobs & reminders** - several background loops in parallel, each doing exactly the one job you described and then checking its own work; plus reminders on a fixed time or a cron expression.
- 🗃️ **Work (Kanban)** - hand over a goal in plain words; the AI writes the spec, picks a worker, runs it in the background and only calls you on exceptions.
- 🧠 **Self-learning** - after each conversation Thansa distils memories, wiki knowledge and skills; every learning pass is a git commit, so it is **one-tap undoable**.
- 🔌 **Multi-account connection store** - Pancake POS, Zalo, Meta/Google/TikTok Ads, Google Workspace, Slack, Webcake, Substack… several accounts per service, each with its own permission level, and Thansa **hard-blocks** anything above that level.
- 📱 **Telegram & Zalo** - ask Thansa over Telegram; read, search history and send Zalo messages through the standard `zalo-agent-cli` MCP.
- 🎨 **Image generation** on the ChatGPT plan you are already signed in to - no separate API key.
- 📊 **Usage** - Thansa measures its own tokens in/out and cost per day and per provider, separating what you typed from what it ran on its own.
- ⇅ **Back the brain up to GitHub** - two-way sync of every brain to a private repo, shared between your home machine and a VPS.
- 🔄 **Multi-engine, no feature loss on a switch** - Claude Code, ChatGPT (Codex), Antigravity CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenRouter, OpenAI API, Google Gemini, Anthropic API, Groq, Ollama. Change it in **Models** with one click; every brain reaches the Thansa MCP hub, the brain file tools and the skills.
- 🌐 **Multilingual** - reply language, interface language and locale are three separate settings. Vietnamese and English ship today; adding a language is a data change, not a code change (see [docs/dev/them-mot-ngon-ngu.md](docs/dev/them-mot-ngon-ngu.md)).
- 🔐 **Safe on a VPS** - login is forced automatically when running publicly, plus account-takeover protection, rate limiting, CSRF blocking and encrypted secrets in the config.

---

## 🚀 Installation

> ⚠️ **Security matters here:** Thansa runs an AI brain with **full rights** on the machine. When it runs publicly (Docker/VPS/Hostinger), Thansa **forces login by itself** - opening the app gives you a create-account / sign-in screen, and nobody drives it without a password.

### Option 1 - Hostinger Docker Manager (domain + HTTPS) ⚡

Hostinger VPS → **Docker Manager → Compose → URL** → paste the **Hostinger file** and **Deploy**:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xahoapro/thansa-os/main/docker-compose.hostinger.yml
```
The **Environment** box on the current template needs only three fields: `DOMAIN_NAME`,
`JAVIS_ADMIN_USER`, `JAVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The technical variables for ports, state,
brains and working directories are hidden because the Docker image sets them correctly.

Set `DOMAIN_NAME` so Hostinger's Traefik issues HTTPS:
- **Free link** (no domain purchase needed): `DOMAIN_NAME=javis.<vps-hostname>.hstgr.cloud`
  (find the hostname under hPanel → VPS, e.g. `javis.srv1562015.hstgr.cloud`).
- **Your own domain:** `DOMAIN_NAME=example.com` + point an A record at the VPS IP.

Deploy → wait 1-3 minutes for Traefik to issue the certificate → open `https://<DOMAIN_NAME>`. (Details and troubleshooting: [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).)

> Just want `http://<ip>:7777` without a domain? Use `docker-compose.yml` (Option 2).

**Three one-time steps:**
1. **Make the GHCR image Public:** GitHub → repo → **Packages** → `javis-os` → *Package settings* → Visibility = **Public**.
2. **Create the admin account** (pick one):
   - *Recommended:* fill in `JAVIS_ADMIN_USER` + `JAVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the Environment box → open the app and **sign straight in**.
   - *Or:* open the app and it asks for a **SETUP TOKEN** - in the **App terminal** (inside the container) run `cat /data/state/.setup_token`.
3. **Sign in to a brain:** App terminal → `claude auth login --claudeai` → open the link, paste the code. (On a ChatGPT plan, sign in on the **Models** page after opening the app.)

### Option 2 - Docker on any VPS (pull the image, no clone needed)

```bash
# Docker required (don't have it?  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh)
mkdir javis && cd javis
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xahoapro/thansa-os/main/docker-compose.yml

docker compose run --rm javis claude auth login --claudeai   # sign in to Claude once
docker compose up -d                                          # pull the image and run
```
Open `http://<vps-ip>:7777` → the admin-account screen (find the SETUP TOKEN in `docker compose logs javis`).

### Option 3 - Install directly on Linux/macOS (no Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xahoapro/thansa-os.git javis && cd javis
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```
The script installs Python + Node + both CLI engines (Claude Code, Codex), creates a venv, registers a systemd service that starts at boot, and prints the address. If it reports Claude is not signed in, run this once: `claude auth login --claudeai`.

### Option 4 - Windows (personal machine)

```
1. Install Python 3.12 (tick "Add to PATH") + Node.js LTS
2. Double-click  setup.bat   (runs in a visible window - installs Claude Code + Codex)
   To run it silently next time: start-javis.vbs   (log at server\javis.log)
3. Open http://localhost:7777 → the Models page, sign in to the brain you want
4. To stop: stop-javis.bat
```

> 🪟 **Windows - open it like an app:** after the first `setup.bat` run, from then on just double-click **`JAVIS OS.bat`** - the server starts in the background (no black window) and the dashboard opens as its **own window** with no address bar and its own taskbar entry. Start at login: `javis-autostart.bat install` (remove: `uninstall`).

### Several Thansa instances on one VPS (each with its own link)

Run as many as you like - brains, settings and accounts are fully separate per instance.
Only three values have to differ between them: `JAVIS_NAME`, `JAVIS_HOST_PORT`, `DOMAIN_NAME`.

- **Hostinger:** deploy `docker-compose.hostinger.yml` as a second stack and fill in those three boxes.
- **Self-managed VPS:** run the shared proxy `docker-compose.proxy.yml` **once for the whole machine**, then give each instance its own folder using `docker-compose.multi.yml`. The proxy discovers new instances and requests SSL by itself - adding one changes nothing on the proxy.
- **Native:** `JAVIS_NAME=javis-shop JAVIS_PORT=7778 ./install.sh`.

Leave those variables empty and you get exactly the old single-instance install. Step by step: **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**.

## 🎬 First-run setup

Open Thansa and the setup wizard walks you through:

1. **Admin account** - set a password (required when running publicly, to keep strangers out).
2. **Pick a brain** - on a subscription you sign in once and need no API key: Claude Code keeps its token in `~/.claude` (Docker: a dedicated volume, so updates do not lose it), and ChatGPT/Codex signs in right on the **Models** page. On an API key you just paste an OpenRouter / OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic key. The Claude Code card also has a **"Run via"** selector: keep the signed-in subscription, or switch to an Anthropic API key. Both keep every capability - they differ only in who pays and who carries the risk (see the warning above).
3. **Pick a model** - Claude Code is preselected, but switching to any provider on the **Models** page **loses no features** (except shell commands, which only the CLI engines have).
4. **Wire up connections** (optional) - go to **Connections**, pick a service from the store and paste a key or scan a QR code. Thansa then reports on real numbers from it.

**Full table of contents (27 pages):** [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) - it also covers [Second Brain: memory / Wiki / INGEST](docs/13-second-brain-bo-nho-wiki.md), [Backing the brain up to GitHub](docs/18-sao-luu-github.md), [Tasks & Dataview in notes](docs/19-task-va-dataview.md), [Branding & custom domains](docs/15-thuong-hieu-ten-mien.md) and [.env configuration](docs/16-cau-hinh-env.md).

### A few common flows

- **Ask for numbers:** *"How is revenue today? Against yesterday?"* → Thansa calls the right connection and returns real figures plus suggestions.
- **Digest knowledge (INGEST):** drop in a file or a note → Thansa summarises it, extracts insight, writes it into the Wiki and proposes tasks.
- **Hand over background work:** go to **Work** → **+ New goal** → describe it in plain words (e.g. *"summarise this week's sales, find slow-moving stock, draft three captions to push it"*) → the AI specs and runs it, then reports back over Telegram.
- **Recurring work:** go to **Recurring** → **+ Add** → choose *Loop* (every N minutes) or *Reminder* (8:30 every day).
- **Voice:** press the mic (or turn on hands-free) → speak → Thansa answers out loud.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`.env`)

Every line can be left empty and it still runs. Copy `env.example` → `.env` (the sample file deliberately has no leading dot, so Hostinger's Docker Manager does not import it into the Environment box).

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `JAVIS_HOST` | Listen address. `127.0.0.1`=this machine only; `0.0.0.0`=public | `127.0.0.1` |
| `JAVIS_PORT` | Port | `7777` |
| `JAVIS_REQUIRE_LOGIN` | `1`/`0` to force login on/off (default: on when bound publicly) | *(auto)* |
| `JAVIS_ADMIN_USER` / `JAVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Create the admin at deploy time (no SETUP TOKEN needed) | - |
| `JAVIS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Extra hostnames on the allow-list (CSRF / DNS-rebinding protection) | localhost + your domain |
| `JAVIS_SECURE_COOKIE` | Force the `Secure` cookie flag. Only turn on with end-to-end HTTPS | *(auto, from the domain)* |
| `JAVIS_STATE_DIR` | Where state is written (settings, sessions, encryption key, recurring-job config) | `server/` (Docker: `/data/state`) |
| `BRAINS_DIR` | Parent folder holding every brain | `brains/` (Docker: `/brains`) |
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` | An external Second Brain vault (if you already have one) | `vault/` (Docker: `/data/vault`) |
| `CLAUDE_CWD` | Working directory for the Claude brain | repo root |
| `JAVIS_ENABLE_USER_PLUGINS` | `true` is required before your own plugins run (real Python inside the server) | *(off)* |
| `WATCHTOWER_TOKEN` | Token for the "Update now" button on the Docker build | `javis-update` |
| `TTS_VOICE` / `TTS_RATE` | Voice and speed (Edge TTS) | `vi-VN-HoaiMyNeural` / `+5%` |

Every variable: [docs/16 - .env configuration](docs/16-cau-hinh-env.md).

---

## 🔐 Security

- When running publicly, **login is required** before any feature works (the brain runs with full rights on the machine).
- Creating the first admin needs a **SETUP TOKEN** (printed in the server log) or an admin preset through env vars → someone who only has the URL cannot claim the account.
- **Login rate limiting** (temporary lockout after repeated failures), passwords ≥ 8 characters, `secure` cookies under HTTPS, sessions expiring after 30 days.
- **CSRF and DNS-rebinding blocked**: any write request with an unknown Origin is rejected.
- **Secrets are encrypted** inside `settings.json` (API keys, OAuth tokens, Telegram bot tokens, backup tokens) with a per-machine key at `JAVIS_STATE_DIR/.secret_key`.
- **Your own plugins are blocked by default** - you have to set `JAVIS_ENABLE_USER_PLUGINS=true` yourself, because they run real Python inside the server process.
- Remote access should go over **HTTPS** (Hostinger `*.hstgr.cloud` or a Cloudflare Tunnel) - do not expose a raw port.

---

## 🔄 Updating

```bash
# On your machine (after changing code): push to GitHub
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push     # → CI builds a new image onto GHCR

# On the VPS: pull the new build
cd javis && ./update.sh          # pulls the image and restarts (volume data is NOT lost)
```

In the app: open **Updates** (System group) → **⬆ Update now** where the environment supports it, with a progress bar and a rollback button if the new build breaks.

## 🌐 Remote access (non-Hostinger VPS)

```bash
docker compose --profile tunnel up -d
docker compose logs tunnel | grep trycloudflare   # → https://xxx.trycloudflare.com
```

```
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI in `server/`.
  - Brains and engines: `claude_sdk_engine.py` (the Claude engine, via the Claude Agent SDK), `claude_cli.py` (factory + auth for Claude/Codex), `antigravity_cli.py`, `gemini_cli.py`, `engine.py` (the API engines plus the MCP tool-call loop), `aux_engine.py` (engine selection for background work + the fallback chain when an engine dies).
  - Tools: `mcp_hub.py`, `mcp_store.py`, `mcp_client.py`, `mcp_catalog.py`, `plugins_host.py`, `oauth_mcp.py`.
  - Background work: `self_improve.py` (recurring jobs), `reminders.py`, `tasks.py` + `task_store.py` (Kanban), `learn.py` (self-learning).
  - Data: `sessions.py`, `compaction.py`, `git_brain.py`, `media_gc.py`, `usage_index.py` + `usage_store.py`.
  - Channels: `telegram_bot.py`, `channel_context.py`; Zalo goes through the MCP Hub.
  - Language and locale: `lang.py` (which language is this turn), `lang_registry.py` (one entry per language), `lexicon/` (per-language safety-gate vocabulary), `localefmt.py` (timezone, currency, formats).
  - Platform: `main.py`, `routes/` (domain, graph), `config.py`, `web_security.py`, `secrets_store.py`.
- **Frontend:** plain HTML/CSS/JS (`dashboard/`) - no framework, light on a VPS. Interface strings live in `dashboard/i18n/`.
- **Second Brain:** a markdown vault in `brains/<brain name>/` - living memory plus an accumulating Wiki.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
|---|---|
| Code changed but nothing looks different | Changed a `.py`? **Restart the server** (Windows: `stop-javis.bat` → `start-javis.vbs`). Changed the UI? **Ctrl+Shift+R**. |
| Port 7777 held, the new build will not come up | Kill the old process FIRST (`stop-javis.bat`, or `taskkill /F /PID <pid>`), then start again. |
| Hostinger cannot pull the image | Set the GHCR package to **Public**; wait for the GitHub Action build to finish (Actions tab). |
| The app asks for a SETUP TOKEN | App terminal (inside the container): `cat /data/state/.setup_token`. On the host: `docker compose logs javis \| grep "SETUP TOKEN"`. Or set `JAVIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` so no token is needed. |
| The brain says it is not signed in | Go to **Models**, find the provider card, press sign in. Or run `claude auth login --claudeai` once (Docker: in the App terminal). |
| Old images in a conversation show a grey box | By design: `attachments/` is a cache that expires after 30 days or 300MB. See [Troubleshooting](docs/17-khac-phuc-su-co.md). |
