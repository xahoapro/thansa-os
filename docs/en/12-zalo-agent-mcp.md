Thansa connects a personal Zalo account through the MCP of
[`javis-zalo`](https://github.com/blogminhquy/javis-zalo), Thansa's own Zalo CLI. There is a single
MCP process: sign in by QR, read or search conversations and send messages through its tools.

> `javis-zalo` uses the unofficial Zalo API via `zca-js`. Zalo does not support this way
> of connecting and the account may be restricted or locked. Use a secondary account, avoid
> automated bulk sending, and accept the risk yourself.

## What you need

- Node.js 20 or newer on the machine or VPS running Thansa, able to download from GitHub (first run).
- A phone already signed in to the Zalo account you want to connect.
- Thansa started and you able to sign in to the dashboard.

Thansa pins `javis-zalo` to a release tag (currently `v1.1.0`) and installs it straight from that
tag's tarball on GitHub, with no npm account or Git needed. Only the `zca-js` library underneath
follows its official npm releases. Since 0.83.0 Thansa runs this build instead of the third-party
`zalo-agent-cli` 1.6.2; connections signed in earlier switch over without a new QR scan.

## Connecting by QR

1. Open **Connections** → find **Zalo Agent MCP** → click **Connect**.
2. Read the risk warning, type a memorable name if you want, then click **Show QR code**.
3. In the Zalo app on your phone, open the QR scanner and scan the code on the dashboard.
4. When the account card appears under **Connected**, the connection is ready.
5. To attach another account, click **＋ Add account**. Each account uses its own session
   folder so they never overwrite one another.

The **Guide on GitHub** button in the Zalo card always opens this documentation page:

## The MCP tools

| Tool | What it does | Action level |
|---|---|---|
| `zalo_get_messages` | Read new messages in the buffer, supports a cursor | Read |
| `zalo_get_history` | Fetch the history of one chat (groups too), paginated, with `replyTo` and `mentions` | Read |
| `zalo_search_history` | Search history across every chat by sender or date range | Read |
| `zalo_get_group_joins` | Who joined a group and when, filtered by group, person or date range | Read |
| `zalo_list_threads` | List the chats currently in the buffer | Read |
| `zalo_search_threads` | Find a group or person by name | Read |
| `zalo_view_media` | Download/open an image, audio or video on the server (the brain does not see it, see `zalo_read_images` below) | Read |
| `zalo_mark_read` | Mark as handled up to a cursor | Write |
| `zalo_send_message` | Send a message to a person or group | Dangerous |

The list follows the `javis-zalo` 1.1.0 source. History only covers what arrived since the MCP
connected, plus what Zalo replays on connect (roughly the last two weeks); nothing older is
available through any API.

## New members joining a group

Since Thansa 0.84.2 (javis-zalo 1.1.0), Thansa knows who just joined a group and **when**,
including people your own account added:

- **You can ask.** "Who joined Zoom | Thansa OS this week?" makes the brain call
  `zalo_get_group_joins` and answer with names and join times. The log lives in
  `~/.zalo-agent-cli/group-joins.jsonl` inside the connection's session folder, keeps the latest
  5000 joins, and survives restarts.
- **A dedicated bot receives the event.** In a group the bot is allowed in, each newcomer is an
  event sent to the bot's Agent, whatever the "reply when" setting says. The Agent follows its own
  instructions (for example a welcome and a question), and what it sends tags the newcomer.
  Thansa has **no greeting of its own**: if the Agent's instructions say nothing about newcomers,
  the bot stays silent. When many people join at once and the bot has hit its rate limit, it also
  stays silent instead of saying "you are typing too fast".
- **Limits.** Zalo only reports this while connected, and the member list carries no join date.
  People who joined before this feature, or while the machine running Thansa was off, are not in
  the log.

## The Zalo extras pack (Thansa Store)

The three groups of tools below (reading images, sending images and files, tagging people plus
notes, reminders and polls) fill exactly what the standard MCP lacks. Since 0.73.0 they live in
the **`javis.zalo`** pack on Thansa Store instead of shipping inside the app, so people who do not
use Zalo do not carry them:

- **Right after you scan the Zalo QR, Thansa offers the pack** through the store's own consent
  screen: it lists every code file, with the "run now" switch on because you just connected
  Zalo yourself. Press Install and every tool is there.
- **On a machine that connected Zalo earlier**, the Connections page shows a reminder with an
  **Install companion pack** button. Thansa never installs a code pack without asking.
- The Zalo connection, the Inbox and the Zalo chatbot stay in the app and keep working without
  the pack. Without it you only miss the extra tools.

## Reading images in a group

The Zalo MCP only returns a **link** to an image, keeps messages for 2 hours, and
`zalo_view_media` opens the image in the server's own image viewer instead of handing it to the
brain. So the `javis.zalo` pack has the `zalo_read_images` tool:

| Tool | What it does | Action level |
|---|---|---|
| `zalo_read_images` | Fetches the images people post in a group into the brain and tells the brain what is in them | Write (saves images to the brain) |

Just ask in chat, for example "look at the receipt Lan just posted in the Sales group".

- **Images come straight from Zalo**, not from the MCP's 2-hour buffer: Thansa asks Zalo for the
  group's recent messages (30 by default, at most 100) and takes up to the 8 newest images. For a
  private chat, only images still in the MCP buffer can be fetched.
- **Images are saved to `attachments/zalo/<group id>/`** in the brain, so they show right in chat.
- **Every brain can "see" them.** Claude Code and Codex open the image file themselves. The API
  engines (OpenRouter, Gemini...) cannot view images, so ChatGPT on the plan you are signed in to
  looks at them and describes them, copying any text and numbers verbatim. Without ChatGPT signed
  in on the Models page the images are still fetched, just without the description.

The part where ChatGPT looks at images lives in the app (the bundled `image-chatgpt` plugin, tool
`javis_describe_image`), so it can view any other image in the brain too, with or without the
Zalo pack.

## Sending images and files

`zalo_send_message` above **only sends text**. To send an image (say one Thansa just generated)
or a file (a PDF report, a spreadsheet), use the `zalo_send_image` tool from the `javis.zalo`
pack. It uses exactly the Zalo account you scanned the QR with.

| Tool | What it does | Action level |
|---|---|---|
| `zalo_send_image` | Send an image or file with a message | Dangerous (Full power level) |

Just say it in chat, for example "send this image to the Sales group" or "send the July report
to Nam over Zalo".

Three things worth knowing:

- **Only files inside the brain in use can be sent.** This is a deliberate safety rail: without
  it, one cleverly worded chat message could make Thansa send any file on the server outside, and
  a Zalo message cannot be recalled.
- **One send carries one kind**, either all images or all files, up to 10 files. Mixing them
  makes Zalo display the wrong type, so Thansa reports back instead of guessing.
- **With several Zalo accounts attached, Thansa asks** which one to send from. Sending from the
  wrong account means sending under someone else's identity, so this is not a place to guess.

Node.js 20+ is required on the machine running Thansa, same as for the Zalo connection itself.

## Tagging people, notes, reminders and polls

`zalo_send_message` only sends text, so it cannot tag anyone, and the Zalo MCP has no notes, reminders or polls either. The
`javis.zalo` pack fills exactly those gaps with five tools that every brain can call:

| Tool | What it does | Action level |
|---|---|---|
| `zalo_group_members` | List the members of a group (id with name), or look one person up by name | Read |
| `zalo_send_mention` | Send a message to a group and tag the right people | Dangerous (Full power level) |
| `zalo_create_note` | Create a group note, can be pinned | Dangerous (Full power level) |
| `zalo_create_reminder` | A reminder shown inside Zalo, with a time and repeat (daily, weekly, monthly) | Dangerous (Full power level) |
| `zalo_create_poll` | A poll for the group: multiple answers, anonymous, closing time | Dangerous (Full power level) |

Just say it in chat, for example "message the Sales group and tag @minhquy: meeting at 9am" or "create a poll in the Thansa class group: what for lunch".

Four things worth knowing:

- **You only need to say a name to tag.** "@minhquy" or "Minh Quý" both work, ignoring case and accents. Thansa looks up the real Zalo
  id among the people who already spoke in that group first, then in Zalo's member list. **If a name is ambiguous or not found, Thansa
  asks back with the candidates** instead of guessing, because a wrong tag cannot be undone. `@All` only when you ask for it explicitly.
- **This reminder is not Thansa's own reminder** (`javis_schedule`): it shows up inside Zalo, so the whole group sees it. Times use Thansa's timezone.
- **If the group locks note or poll creation for members**, Zalo refuses and Thansa reports that reason as is. If a command times out,
  Thansa says it is **not sure whether it was created** and asks you to check the group before trying again, so you do not get two polls.
- **With several Zalo accounts attached, Thansa asks** which one to use, same as for sending images.

## Using it in chat

You can speak naturally:

- "Find the Sales group on Zalo."
- "Read the 20 most recent messages in the Sales group."
- "Any new Zalo messages?"
- "Send the Sales group: meeting at 9am tomorrow."

When sending, state the name or `threadId` clearly, the content, and whether it is a person or a
group. If the search returns several chats with the same name, Thansa must ask back rather than
guess. If exactly one result matches, Thansa sends right away with `zalo_send_message`; no
listener has to be enabled, the recipient does not have to message first, and nothing depends on
a watch list.

## Permissions

A new connection defaults to **Full power** so that `zalo_send_message` can be used.

- **Read only**: only the five read tools.
- **Draft writes**: adds `zalo_mark_read`, still blocks sending.
- **Full power**: allows sending (`zalo_send_message`, `zalo_send_image`) and the tools that tag people or create notes, reminders and polls.

You change the level in the menu of the account chip on the **Connections** page. Background
work running at a restricted level is still blocked from sending by the MCP Hub, even when the
account is set to Full power.

## Differences from the old Zalo integration

The new flow dropped the `listen --webhook` sidecar, the `/hook/zalo` endpoint, the "Listen
continuously" panel, the per-chat rules file and the two plugins `javis_zalo_rule` and
`javis_zalo_send`. No listener process turns the MCP connector off and back on any more.

Because of that, Thansa does not forward Zalo messages to Telegram in the background. When you
want to check messages, ask Thansa; MCP can use `zalo_get_messages` for buffered messages or
`zalo_get_history` for history.

## Troubleshooting

- **No QR appears**: check that `node --version` is 20 or higher and that the machine can reach
  npm and GitHub (`codeload.github.com`).
- **QR expired**: close the connection window and click **Connect** to generate a new code.
- **A chat is missing**: try `zalo_search_threads`; for older messages use `zalo_get_history`
  rather than only `zalo_get_messages`.
- **The send tool is blocked**: open the account chip menu and switch the level to **Full
  power**.
- **It reports the session is in use elsewhere**: close Zalo Web or another `javis-zalo`
  (or old `zalo-agent-cli`) process using the same account, then try again.
- **You want to sign in from scratch**: delete the connection on the dashboard, then connect and
  scan the QR again. Other connections' session folders are unaffected.
