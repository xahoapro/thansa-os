# Agents & Workflows

*[Tiếng Việt](../07-agents-va-workflows.md) · **English***

This is where you create specialised AI assistants (Agents) and chain them into automated pipelines (Workflows). For example: a research agent, a writing agent and a reviewing agent, chained into "research > write > verify" that produces a result in one run.

## What this feature is

- **An Agent** is an "AI employee" with a fixed role. Each agent has: a name, a role description, a detailed working instruction (system prompt), a list of skills it may use, a **model to run on**, and its **own memory** that accumulates over time. The model can come from **any provider you connected** on the Models page: Claude (Claude Code), ChatGPT (Codex), Grok Build CLI, Antigravity CLI, OpenRouter, Anthropic API, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq. The picker reads straight from your connected providers, so connecting more adds more choices. Every provider can read and write vault files and use MCP; Claude Code and Codex additionally have shell commands and can browse the web. If the chosen provider fails at runtime, Thansa falls back to another brain rather than leaving the agent silent. (Ollama cannot run agents yet, so it does not appear here.) An agent's model is REALLY applied when the workflow runs.
  - Safety note: when a workflow runs **automatically in the background** (the Kanban dispatcher, restricted file-tool mode), the agent always uses Claude Code to keep the safe tool restrictions, even if you picked another provider. Your chosen model applies when you send a message on the **Partners** page.
- **A Workflow** is a chain of steps, each handing one task to one agent. The result of a step can flow into the next. You can attach a **verification step**: another agent playing the reviewer, which by default assumes the result is wrong and must be proven otherwise; if it fails, the workflow retries a few times.
- Every agent and workflow is stored as an **.md file in the vault** (the selected brain), so you can read them, edit them by hand, and Thansa can create them from chat.

## Where to find it in Thansa

Open **Capabilities > Partners** in the dashboard sidebar (port 7777 by default). The page has **Agents | Workflows** tabs. Skills and Plugins remain in Capabilities.

- Left: choose a tab, search or filter by group, then select a partner. Recently used agents and workflows appear first.
- Centre: chat with the selected partner.
- Right: agent settings and conversations, or workflow progress and run history.

On narrow screens, use the list and details buttons to open the side drawers. Switching brains switches the lists and conversations.

## Chatting with an agent

1. Choose **Agents**, then select an agent in the left column.
2. Send a message in the centre. Replies use the agent's configured role, instructions and private memory.
3. Edit its name, role, instructions, skills or model on the right and click **Save**.
4. Use the new conversation button to start a separate chat with the same agent. Each agent can have several conversations; reopen recent conversations on the right to continue.

Partner conversations are separate from Thansa's main chat history. Returning to a partner resumes its most recent conversation.

## Creating, searching and Thansa Store

Choose a tab and use the create agent or workflow button at the bottom of the left column. **Thansa Store** opens the matching package catalogue. Set **Group** in the editor to organise a partner.

Search matches names, slugs, roles or descriptions and supports accent-free typing. Search and group filters work together. Items without a group belong to **Chung** (General). Unused items follow recently used items, ordered by name.

## Creating an Agent (step by step, through the form)

1. Open **Partners > Agents**.
2. Click the create agent button at the bottom left. An editor opens on the right of the screen.
3. Fill in:

| Field | Meaning | Suggestion |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | The agent name shown on the card. Required. | e.g. "Email specialist" |
| **Role (short description)** | One sentence about what the agent does. | e.g. "Writes sales emails in a friendly voice" |
| **Group** | A group name so the dashboard files the agent in the left column. Type a new one or pick an existing one (the field suggests). Leave it empty and the agent falls into "Chung". | e.g. Marketing, Sales, Content |
| **System prompt (detailed working instructions)** | The long, detailed instruction: how the agent works, its principles, the output you expect. | e.g. writing rules, banned words, output format |
| **Skills** | The skills available in the vault; tick the ones the agent may use. | Pick skills matching the role |
| **Model** | A picker with 8 options, see the table below. | Sonnet for balance, Opus for deep reasoning, Haiku for fast and cheap |

4. Click **Save**. If you forget the Name, Thansa says "Enter a name".
5. The new agent card appears in the list with a 🤖 icon, the model name and the assigned skill labels. With no skills assigned, the card reads "no skills assigned".

A note on the Skills field: the list comes from the vault's skill folder. If the vault has no skills, the panel says so and notes that you can create the agent now and assign skills later. Creating skills is covered on the [Skills](06-skills.md) page.

### What the Model picker offers

| Option | Group | Runs on |
|---|---|---|
| **Default (per CLI)** | (no group) | See the explanation under the table |
| **Sonnet** | Claude (Claude Code) | Claude Code |
| **Opus** | Claude (Claude Code) | Claude Code |
| **Haiku** | Claude (Claude Code) | Claude Code |
| **Fable** | Claude (Claude Code) | Claude Code |
| **GPT-5.5** | ChatGPT (Codex, requires a ChatGPT login) | Codex CLI |
| **GPT-5.4** | ChatGPT (Codex, requires a ChatGPT login) | Codex CLI |
| **GPT-5.3 Codex** | ChatGPT (Codex, requires a ChatGPT login) | Codex CLI |

Under the Model field there is a note: agents run through the provider's CLI, so choosing Claude means Claude Code and choosing ChatGPT means Codex (which requires being signed into ChatGPT on the machine or VPS). Both read and write vault files and use MCP.

**What "Default (per CLI)" really does:** left empty, Thansa takes the **auxiliary model** you set on the **Models** page first (only when that auxiliary model is a Claude model); with no Claude auxiliary model it falls back to the CLI's default. If you want an agent to always run on one specific model regardless of the global configuration, pick that model explicitly instead of leaving it empty.

### An agent's own memory and run log

Besides the `.md` file, each agent has two more things inside the brain's `memory/agents/<slug>/` folder:

- **`MEMORY.md`, its own memory.** Every time the agent runs, Thansa reads this file and injects it into the agent's system prompt under the heading `# Your memory:`. This is where long-term knowledge accumulates: house conventions, a client list, mistakes it was corrected on. The file has **two writers**: you by hand, and the agent **adding to it as it runs**. At the end of a task, if it learned something reusable, the agent proposes it and Thansa writes it into the `## Lessons (self-learned)` section. Thansa holds the pen rather than the model, so there are hard rails: duplicate lessons are dropped, only the 15 newest lines are kept so the memory gets denser rather than longer, and the part you wrote by hand outside that section is never touched. That means the agent gets smarter with each use, with no bulk background job.
- **`runs/`, the run log.** After each workflow step (verification steps included), Thansa appends an entry to `runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with the time, the task given and the result (trimmed). This is where you check "what did this agent do yesterday" without reopening the run panel. This raw log does not go into the brain's git history.

Both are ordinary text files: open, read and edit them through [File manager](05-file-manager.md). To teach an agent something, write it straight into `memory/agents/<slug>/MEMORY.md` and it knows on the next run.

To be clear: this memory belongs to **one agent**; Thansa's shared memory about you and the business lives in `memory/MEMORY.md` and `memory/facts/`, see [Second Brain: memory, Wiki, INGEST](13-second-brain.md).

### Editing or deleting an agent

- **Edit**: select the agent, change its settings on the right and click **Save**.
- **⤓ Export**: package the agent (with its skills) into a `.zip` to share, see "Sharing" at the end of this page.
- **Delete**: click **Delete** and confirm in the "Delete agent ...?" dialog. Note: if a workflow uses that agent, its step will point at an agent that no longer exists, so check related workflows afterwards. Deleting an agent does **not** delete `memory/agents/<slug>/`, so its old memory and logs remain on disk.

## Creating a Workflow (step by step, through the form)

Create at least one agent in the **Agents** tab before creating a workflow.

1. Open **Partners > Workflows**.
2. Click the create workflow button at the bottom left.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: the workflow name. Required.
   - **Description**: one line about what it does (optional but recommended; it shows on the workflow card).
   - **Group**: a group name so it files into the left column, typed fresh or picked from existing groups. Left empty, it lands in "Chung".
4. In **Steps (each step = 1 agent · use {{input}} and {{prev}})**, every step is a block with:
   - A **Task** field: what this step must do. Two special variables are available:
     - `{{input}}` = the input you type when you run the workflow.
     - `{{prev}}` = the result of the immediately preceding step.
   - A **Verification** section (optional): pick an agent to review this step, and how many retries are allowed. Leave it at "- no verification -" if not needed. The retry count defaults to 1 and ranges from 0 to 5.
5. Click **+ Step** to add another step.
6. Click **Save**. If you forget the Name, Thansa says "Enter a name". New workflows are saved in the ready (active) state.

### A step's header row

Each step has a header row, left to right:

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Number | 1, 2, 3... in run order |
| Summary line | "agent name · task" condensed to one line |
| Agent picker | Change which agent owns this step |
| **↑** | Move the step up (dimmed on the first step) |
| **↓** | Move the step down (dimmed on the last step) |
| **✕** | Delete this step (at the END of the header row) |

**Collapsing and expanding steps:** click the header row (an empty part, not a button or picker) to collapse or expand that step's body. Opening an existing workflow to **edit** collapses every step by default so you see the whole pipeline first; click a step to open it. A **new** workflow has only one step, so it opens expanded.

Text you are typing is not lost when you collapse, reorder or delete another step; Thansa captures every step's content before each redraw.

### A 2-step example

- Step 1: agent **Researcher**, task: `Research this topic thoroughly: {{input}}. Find sources, summarise the key insights.`
- Step 2: agent **Writer**, task: `Write a complete article about '{{input}}' based on this research:` then a line break and `{{prev}}`. In Verification, pick the **Verifier** agent with 2 retries.


### Editing, exporting or deleting a workflow

Select a workflow in the left column. The right column has **Edit**, **Export** and **Delete** buttons and its steps. Edit opens the workflow editor; saving refreshes the list and details.

## Running a workflow

1. Open **Partners > Workflows** and select a workflow on the left.
2. Send a request in chat. Each message starts one run; its text supplies `{{input}}`.
3. Follow step progress on the right. Steps with verification may retry using the verifier's feedback and the configured retry limit.
4. If approval is required, read the request and use the approval button on the right to continue. Errors and waiting states also appear in chat.
5. The final result arrives in chat. The next message in the same conversation includes the previous result, so you can request a revision, such as "Keep the main points but make it shorter".

**Run history** on the right lists recent runs. Select a run to inspect its details and reopen its conversation when it has a chat session. Recently run workflows move to the top of the list. In Thansa's main chat you can also ask "How did the latest workflow run go?" to query saved runs from Partners and Kanban.

Each step still writes its agent log under `memory/agents/<slug>/runs/`. After a connection loss, check run history before sending the request again to avoid duplicate runs.

## Creating agents and workflows in words (through chat)

You are not required to use the form. In the chat with Thansa (see [Chat & voice](02-chat-and-voice.md)) you can ask in words, for example:

- "Create an agent that writes sales emails."
- "Create a workflow that researches then writes an article."
- "Add an editing step to workflow X."

Thansa then writes the matching .md file into the vault, sets an accent-free slug, files it in a group (reading the groups already used in the brain and picking the closest), assigns sensible skills from what exists, and if a workflow references an agent that does not exist yet, creates that agent first. Afterwards Thansa reports briefly which files it created or edited. Return to the Partners page and they are there, with nothing else to do.

This is handy when you can describe the intent in words but do not want to fill in forms, or when you want to adjust several steps at once.

## Where agents and workflows are stored

In the current brain layout, each agent is a file at `agents/<slug>.md` and each workflow at `workflows/<slug>.md`. The `slug` is lowercase, hyphenated and accent-free (so "viết email" becomes `viet-email`).

**Older brains that have not migrated** keep those two folders at `Javis/agents/` and `Javis/workflows/`. Thansa detects it: if the new folder exists it uses it, otherwise it uses the old path. So if the Files page shows no `agents/` at the brain root, look inside `Javis/`.

Because they are text files, you can open them through [File manager](05-file-manager.md) to read or edit by hand. The file structure:

- Agent: the frontmatter holds the name, role, group (`group`), skill list and model; the body is the detailed system prompt. Its own memory and run log live outside this file, in `memory/agents/<slug>/`.
- Workflow: the frontmatter holds the name, status (active or off), group (`group`), description and the list of steps (each with an agent, a task, and optionally a verifying agent plus a retry count).

The `group` field is written the same way for agents, workflows and skills, so editing it by hand works too: write `group: Marketing` and the next page load files it correctly. Without the field it lands in "Chung".

Edit and save a file and the Partners page picks up the new content on the next load.

## Tips

- **Always separate a verification step for important work.** Make the verifier a different agent from the doer, because it is forced into the "assume the result is wrong" role. That is how you reduce sloppy or invented output.
- **One step, one job.** Do not cram "research and write and publish" into one step. Splitting it keeps control and makes each part fixable.
- **Use `{{prev}}` to connect the chain.** A later step that needs the previous result must mention `{{prev}}` in its task, otherwise the agent never sees that output.
- **Reorder with ↑/↓ instead of deleting and redoing.** Wrong order only needs a nudge up or down; the content moves intact.
- **Keep retries moderate.** 1 to 2 is usually enough. Setting them high makes the workflow slow and expensive when the result is hard to reach.
- **Match the model to the job.** Reasoning-heavy steps (analysis, verification) suit Opus; simple, high-volume steps suit Haiku for speed and cost. Details in [Models & engines](10-models-and-engines.md).
- **Assign skills where they belong.** An agent is only strong with the right skills. A sales page agent should carry the sales page skill. Skill management is in [Skills](06-skills.md).
- **Use the private memory for anything repetitive.** Instructions you would otherwise repeat every run belong in `memory/agents/<slug>/MEMORY.md` rather than stuffed into the system prompt.

## Sharing: Export / Import (agents, skills, workflows)

You can package an agent, skill or workflow into **one `.zip`** to send to someone else, and take someone else's package into your brain.

- **Export:** each agent / skill / workflow card has a **⤓ Export** button that downloads a `.zip`. The package **includes dependencies** so the recipient can run it immediately: exporting a workflow includes the agents it uses and those agents' skills; exporting an agent includes its skills. **System** skills are not packaged, because every brain already has them.
- **Safety:** on import, Thansa blocks unusual paths inside the package (nothing may be written outside the agent/skill/workflow folders) and limits the size to guard against malicious files. Even so, only import packages from sources you trust, because skill content is instructions the AI follows.

Note: an exported package only contains definition files. **An agent's memory and run log do not travel with it**, so the recipient gets the role and the skills, not the memories.

## Quick actions and troubleshooting

- **Create:** choose a tab and use the create button at the bottom left, or open **Thansa Store**.
- **New conversation:** start a separate session with the selected partner.
- **Edit / Export / Delete:** use the selected partner's right column.
- **Empty list:** check the selected brain, search and group filter, then create a partner if needed.
- **Missing settings or history:** use the details button above chat to open the right column, especially on narrow screens.
- **Missing workflow agent:** create that agent first, then select it in the step editor.
- **Connection loss or run error:** read the chat message and run history before sending the request again.
- **Page stuck loading:** check the server on port 7777 and see [Troubleshooting & FAQ](17-troubleshooting.md).
