# Branding and custom domains

*[Tiếng Việt](../15-thuong-hieu-ten-mien.md) · **English***

This page covers two things: changing Thansa's logo/avatar to your own image, and pointing a custom domain (`javis.yourname.com`, say) at Thansa so it runs over HTTPS. Both live under **Settings → Voice, branding and access**.

## What this feature is

- **Avatar (logo):** replace the default JAVIS OS image with your own. The new image appears immediately in the top left corner, in the sidebar, on the sign-in screen, in the welcome window, and becomes the browser tab icon (favicon) too.
- **Custom domain (HTTPS):** instead of opening Thansa by IP and port (something like `http://12.34.56.78:7777`), you use a memorable domain with the HTTPS padlock. Thansa obtains the HTTPS certificate itself (On-Demand TLS through Caddy), and there is an **Enable SSL** button to request the certificate on demand rather than waiting.

One important note up front: the **Custom domain** section only works when you deploy Thansa with Docker on a VPS with ports 80/443 open. If you run Thansa on a personal machine, the logo change works normally but the domain section cannot reach HTTPS. Deploy details in [.env configuration](16-env-configuration.md) and the `DEPLOY.md` file in the project folder.

## Where to open it in Thansa

Both features are under **Settings → Voice, branding and access**. If the group is collapsed, click the heading to open it. Inside are two cards:

- The **AVATAR** box: a preview image, an **Upload image** button and a **Restore default** button.
- The **DOMAIN AND SSL** box: an input (placeholder "e.g. javis.yourname.com"), a **Save and check** button, two status badges for DNS and SSL, two buttons **Enable SSL** and **Check again**, plus a three-step wizard whose content matches your actual VPS/Hostinger environment.

Every time you open Settings, Thansa reloads the current values, checks DNS/HTTPS and shows the correct next step.

## Changing the logo/avatar (step by step)

1. Open **Settings → Voice, branding and access** and find the **AVATAR** box.
2. Click **Upload image**. Your machine's file picker opens.
3. Pick an image file. Accepted formats: PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF. Maximum size 5MB.
4. After picking, Thansa shows the status line **Uploading…** then **Image updated ✓** when done. The new image replaces the old one everywhere immediately (top corner, sidebar, sign-in screen, preview box) with no page reload.

The browser tab icon (favicon) is the one exception and lags a beat: Thansa serves it with a 5-minute cache, and browsers hold onto icons stubbornly. To see it right away, reopen the tab or reload bypassing the cache.

### Restoring the default image

1. In the **AVATAR** box, click **Restore default**.
2. Thansa shows **Restoring…** then **Back to the default image.** The logo returns to the system original.

### Image status messages you may see

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Using a custom image. | You uploaded your own image and Thansa is using it. |
| Using the default image. | No custom image uploaded, or you restored the default. |
| Uploading… | The image is being sent to the server. |
| Image updated ✓ | The new image was accepted and applied. |
| Restoring… | The custom image is being removed. |
| Back to the default image. | Removal finished, the original image is in use again. |
| Upload failed | The server rejected the file (wrong format, too large or empty). The specific reason replaces this line when the server sends one. |
| Network error while uploading | The connection dropped midway, try again. |
| Could not restore | The custom image could not be removed, try again. |

## Pointing a custom domain and enabling HTTPS (step by step)

This section assumes you deployed Thansa with Docker on a VPS, enabled Caddy (On-Demand TLS) and opened ports 80/443. If not, do the deploy part first following `DEPLOY.md`.

### Step A: enter and save the domain

1. Open **Settings → Voice, branding and access** and find the **DOMAIN AND SSL** box.
2. Enter the domain (or subdomain) you want in the input, for example `javis.yourname.com`. No need to type `https://`; if you do, Thansa strips it.
3. Click **Save and check** (or press Enter in the input). Thansa shows **Saving and checking…**, saves the domain, then runs the DNS/SSL check and draws the three-step wizard right in the UI.
4. If the domain is malformed, Thansa reports that the domain is invalid and gives the example format. Fix it and save again.

To **remove** the domain: clear the input and click **Save and check**. Thansa reports the domain was removed and hides the instructions.

### Step B: create the DNS record as instructed

After saving (or when you click **Check again**), the wizard shows step **2. Point DNS at the VPS** with the record to create and a **Copy record** button. The record appears as one compact line `A · <domain> · <server IP>`:

1. Go to the domain management page at your provider (where you bought the domain) and create a record:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Type | A |
   | Name/Host | the domain you just entered, e.g. `javis.yourname.com` |
   | Value/Points to | your VPS server's IP address (Thansa detects and prefills this IP in the wizard) |

2. Wait for DNS to propagate (a few minutes to a few hours), then click **Check again**. Once DNS is right, step 2 turns into a ✓ and the description changes to say the A record points at the server IP.

### Step C: click Enable SSL to request the certificate

Once step 2 is ✓, the wizard shows step **3. Enable HTTPS** with the line saying that once DNS is correct you should click Enable SSL so Thansa requests the certificate.

1. Click **Enable SSL**. Thansa shows **Enabling SSL and requesting the certificate… (may take about 10 seconds)**.
2. The server records the intent to enable SSL then opens `https://<domain>/health` from itself. That very call is what forces Caddy to go and fetch the certificate the first time, instead of you having to open a browser manually.
3. When it finishes, Thansa re-runs the check and updates the badges. Once the certificate is live, the status line reads **HTTPS is running for `<domain>`.**, the button relabels to **Re-activate**, and the wizard adds an **Open https://`<domain>` ↗** link.
4. If it did not come up, Thansa states the reason and adds the line **"On a VPS run: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.https.yml up -d"** when you are on the Docker build without the HTTPS layer enabled.

The **Check again** button is usable at any time: it only reads state (showing **Checking…** then redrawing the badges) and never touches the certificate.

On Hostinger the **Enable SSL** button is hidden, because hPanel's Traefik is what issues certificates. See the Hostinger section below.

## Quick reference of buttons and states

The two badges sit right under the domain input:

| DNS badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DNS: checking | No result yet (the page just opened) |
| DNS: pointing correctly | The A record matches the server IP |
| DNS: wrong IP (`<ip>`) | A record exists but points elsewhere, the actual IP in brackets |
| DNS: not pointed | No record could be resolved for the domain |

| SSL badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| SSL: checking | No result yet |
| SSL: on | HTTPS genuinely runs for the domain |
| SSL: via Hostinger | Deployed on Hostinger, hPanel's Traefik handles the certificate |
| SSL: pending | You enabled SSL but the certificate is not live yet |
| SSL: off | SSL is not enabled for this domain |

| Button | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Save and check** | Saves the domain into Thansa then runs the DNS/SSL check |
| **Enable SSL** | Records the intent and actively forces Caddy to request the certificate now |
| **Re-activate** | The same button relabelled once HTTPS is running; click to request the certificate again |
| **Check again** | Only reads DNS/SSL state, never touches the certificate |
| **Copy record** | Copies the line `A · <domain> · <IP>` to the clipboard (changes to "Copied ✓" for about a second) |
| **Copy variable** | Only in the Hostinger wizard: copies the line `DOMAIN_NAME=<domain>` |

The status line at the bottom of the card can read:

| Status line | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| No domain set. | No domain saved yet. | Enter a domain then click Save and check. |
| Saving and checking… / Checking… | Running, wait a moment. | Nothing. |
| Saved. Checking DNS/SSL… | The domain was written, DNS is being resolved. | Wait for the result. |
| Domain removed. | You just saved an empty field. | Nothing. |
| HTTPS is running for `<domain>`. | All done. | Nothing more needed. |
| You are on HTTPS | You are accessing that very domain over HTTPS. | Done. |
| Certificate not valid yet, DNS is not pointing correctly or the certificate has not been issued | The connection works but the certificate is unusable. | Check the DNS badge; if DNS is right, wait a bit then click Enable SSL again. |
| Cannot reach port 443, Caddy/HTTPS is not running or another proxy holds ports 80/443 | Nothing answers on port 443. | Enable the HTTPS layer with the command Thansa suggests, and check whether another service holds ports 80/443. |
| Saved in Thansa; the DOMAIN_NAME and Redeploy steps on Hostinger remain. | Hostinger: the Traefik route does not match the domain yet. | Do step 3 of the Hostinger wizard. |
| Enter and save a domain first. | You clicked Enable SSL with the domain field empty. | Enter a domain and save. |
| Invalid domain (e.g. javis.yourname.com) | The string is not shaped like a domain. | Drop spaces, drop any trailing path, type it as `name.yourname.com`. |
| Enabling SSL failed | The server refused to enable it. | Read the accompanying reason line. |
| Could not check (network error). | The browser could not reach the server. | Try again in a few minutes. |
| Network error while saving / Network error while enabling SSL | The connection dropped midway. | Try again. |

## About Caddy and On-Demand TLS (worth knowing)

- Thansa uses Caddy to obtain and renew HTTPS certificates automatically (Let's Encrypt) through On-Demand TLS. You never install a certificate by hand.
- To prevent abuse, before issuing a certificate Caddy asks Thansa (through the internal `/tls-check` gate) and only issues for the exact domain you entered in the app. A stranger pointing DNS at your server IP cannot force it to request arbitrary certificates.
- To change or remove the domain on a Caddy VPS, just edit the **DOMAIN AND SSL** field, click **Save and check**, then **Enable SSL** for the new domain. Hostinger needs a Redeploy when the Traefik route changes.
- Enabling Caddy (running `docker compose ... up -d` with the HTTPS config file) and opening ports 80/443 are infrastructure deploy steps outside this interface. See the detailed deploy guide in the project's `DEPLOY.md`.
- When you reach Thansa through the custom domain over HTTPS, the server marks the login cookie `secure` on its own, with no need to set `JAVIS_SECURE_COOKIE` manually. See [Security and accounts](14-security-and-accounts.md).

## If you deploy on Hostinger (a different path)

A Hostinger VPS already runs the Traefik reverse proxy handling SSL, and Traefik holds ports 80/443. Thansa still lets you enter a domain, check DNS and prepare the variable you need right in the UI, but the container has no authority to edit hPanel's Traefik routes. So the **Enable SSL** button is hidden, the SSL badge reads **SSL: via Hostinger**, and step 3 of the wizard becomes **3. Activate the HTTPS route on Hostinger**:

1. Point DNS: the record `A  <your domain> → <Hostinger VPS IP>`.
2. Deploy with the compose file carrying Hostinger's Traefik labels: `docker-compose.hostinger.yml` (Docker Manager → Compose → URL).
3. Click **Copy variable** in the wizard, set `DOMAIN_NAME=<your domain>` in Docker Manager then click **Redeploy**. The wizard also shows the current Traefik route so you can compare.
4. Open `https://<domain>`; Traefik requests the certificate on the first visit. No more entering through `:7777`.

If you try to click Enable SSL on Hostinger (through the API, say), Thansa refuses and states plainly that Hostinger manages HTTPS through Traefik, so set `DOMAIN_NAME` in Docker Manager and Redeploy.

After the Redeploy, return to Settings and click **Check again**. Details and troubleshooting are in the "Domain + HTTPS on Hostinger" section of `DEPLOY.md`; both documentation links also sit right under the domain card.

## Tips

- The logo image should be square (1:1) so it is not cropped oddly, since Thansa shows it in a rounded square frame.
- If somewhere still shows the old image after an upload, wait about a minute or reload the page; the system caches the logo briefly (the favicon longer, about 5 minutes).
- If you have no custom domain but still want remote access over HTTPS, there are other ways (Cloudflare Tunnel, for instance) described in `DEPLOY.md`.
- Use a proper **A** record (IPv4). Do not use a CNAME for this domain unless you fully understand the consequences.
- Do not click **Enable SSL** repeatedly while DNS is still wrong. Each click makes Thansa force Caddy to request a certificate, and many failed requests hit Let's Encrypt rate limits.

## Common problems

- **Saving reports "Invalid domain":** check the spelling, no spaces, no trailing path. The correct shape is `name.yourname.com`.
- **The A record exists but the badge still says "DNS: not pointed":** DNS needs time to propagate. Wait a few more minutes to a few hours then click **Check again**.
- **The badge says "DNS: wrong IP (...)":** the IP in the A record differs from the Thansa server's IP. Copy the exact IP Thansa shows in step 2 of the wizard and update the A record.
- **DNS is right but Enable SSL reports "Cannot reach port 443":** the HTTPS layer is not running. On a Docker VPS, run exactly the command Thansa suggests (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.https.yml up -d`) then click again, and check that ports 80/443 are open and not held by another proxy.
- **Enable SSL reports "Certificate not valid yet":** usually DNS only just became correct and Caddy has not finished issuing. Wait a minute or two then click again.
- **There is no Enable SSL button:** you are running on Hostinger. Thansa hides it because only hPanel's Traefik can issue the certificate; follow the Hostinger wizard above.
- **The upload reports a format error or "too large":** use only PNG, JPG, WEBP or GIF, under 5MB.
- **The Domain field does not behave as expected on a personal machine:** this feature is for the Docker deploy on a VPS with ports 80/443. On a personal machine the domain/HTTPS part will not activate.
