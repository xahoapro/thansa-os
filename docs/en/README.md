# 📚 Thansa OS documentation

*[Tiếng Việt](../README.md) · **English***

Detailed guides for every feature of Thansa OS. Each page is a standalone how-to: where to open it, what to click, how to use it.

> Just starting? Read [Installation in the README](../../README.en.md) first, then go to [01 - Getting started and first setup](01-getting-started.md).

The dashboard's navigation rail groups **19 pages** into **7 groups**: Assistant · Brain · Code · Capabilities · Work · Connections · System. The table of contents below follows the same logic.

## Table of contents

### Getting started
- [01 - Getting started and first setup](01-getting-started.md) - creating the admin, signing the brain in, choosing an engine and model, the Settings page.

## Also in English at the repository root

- [README.en.md](../../README.en.md) - what Thansa is and how to install it.
- [QUICKSTART.en.md](../../QUICKSTART.en.md) - the first 10 minutes.
- [DEPLOY.en.md](../../DEPLOY.en.md) - installing on a server or VPS.
- [CONTRIBUTING.en.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.en.md) - contributing to the project.

Screenshots, button names and menu paths match the interface language you selected on the Settings page, so an English page lines up with an English interface everywhere.

## Adding a language

Translating documentation is step 6 of the language playbook, and it is deliberately last: Thansa answers, routes and formats correctly in a new language long before its documentation is translated. The four required steps are in [docs/dev/them-mot-ngon-ngu.md](../dev/them-mot-ngon-ngu.md) (Vietnamese).

> Documentation conventions: practical and concise. Never use the em dash character (U+2014), always the hyphen "-" instead. See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for the system conventions aimed at AI agents.
